  - Oh so you wanna fight then!?
  - Yea, thats what I thought!
  - Now listen up lackey, you work for me!
  - And our first order of business...
  - Go collect 10000 souls!
  - Then come back and bring them to me...
  - Why do you look so confused?
  - You kill things and collect their souls! Is that hard to understand?
  - The stronger the the thing you kill the more souls it'll have stored up.
  - However, since you're still weak, you might wanna use some souls to power up.
  - Just stand in that magic circle over there and press X, and you'll be able to
    convert souls to power!
  - Now get going, or I will shoot!
