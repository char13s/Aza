  - Go on say something else!
  - No? Ready to listen?
  - Okay so, normally you'd collect your own spirits, but theres no time for that.
  - So your first order of business is...
  - To jump in that portal and beat the boss in that realm!
  - Then come back and bring me their hea...
  - Why do you look so confused?
  - Why don't I do it myself?
  - Because why would I do all that work?!
  - Well since you're still weak, you might wanna use some spirits to power up.
  - Just stand in that magic circle over there and press X, and you'll be able to
    convert spirits to power!
  - Here Ill give you some spirits to power up, now get going, or I will shoot!
